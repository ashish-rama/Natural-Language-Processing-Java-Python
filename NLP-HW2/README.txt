the input file is "test_dollar_phone_corpus.txt" for both programs

to run both programs, it is "java [name of program] test_dollar_phone_corpus.txt"

the output files with brackets are labeled either "bracket_output_dollar.txt" or "bracket_output_phone.txt"

the output files for the list of dollar amounts/phone numbers extracted are labeled "dollar_output.txt" and "phone_output.txt" respectively

NOTE: FOR SOME REASON for my bracket output for the dollar amount program, when replacing the old values, the first 2 or 3 digits are cut off and not showing up correctly in the output file. I couldn't find a fix even though it is the same code used for bracket replacement for the phone number program bracket output.
